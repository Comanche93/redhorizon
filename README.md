Red Horizon
===========

An ongoing project of mine with the goal of recreating the original 2D Command &
Conquer (C&C) games.  The focus is on backwards-compatibility with the original
games, then to create an extensive tool suite aimed at modding the game.

This project has no _finish_ date, has already been going for 6-7 years, and is
really just a way for me to keep my programming skills sharp and to maintain my
interest in C&C and game programming in general.

The most useful outcome of this project has been a set of command-line file
conversion tools, particularly for file formats not already covered by existing
tools.  A download bundle of the file conversion tools can be found [on my website](http://www.ultraq.net.nz/redhorizon/downloads/).

I became interested in the C&C universe through Red Alert, for which I made a
total conversion / campaign, [Campaign Ultraq](http://www.ultraq.net.nz/campaign/).

projects ever released.
